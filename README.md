# Ansible
Ansible-examples

In this project, I used playbook to connect to 2 virtual machines and make the following changes: update packages, install Htop, Tree, Epiphany, Nginx, PostgreSQL using apt. Also installed Vscod using the deb-package, downloaded, installed and removed this deb. After installation, PostgreSQL created a database and tables in it. I also configured Nginx, there is configuration(my_site.conf). After that, I posted an SSL certificate on the site.
